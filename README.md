About https://penexam.github.io
I created this portfolio site to showcase the skills learned in CTI 110, and to share my knowledge as a Cybersecurity student.

To create this site, I took the following steps: 
1. Accessed my github account and created a new repository
2. Accessed the new repository on the Github desktop app
3. Copied my portfolio files to the repository
4. Committed and pushed the files to production on Github
